# FSU Easter Egg Command

This is a command that can be run with multiple flags to output different
FSU related ASCII art. 

# ASCII Art ideas

* Seminole head
* Spear (horizontal and verticle)
* Regenagde the horse
* "Go Noles"

These ascii art ideas will be accessed by different flags appended to the
fsu command

A default piece of art should be displayed with a hint to view the man page
for more ideas


# Motivation
This could be a "fun" command to show students just learning how to use 
linux commands and show some school spirit in the process.
